Data generation : 
os module in python does not support asynchronous mechanism , sometimes the writing of the files in copy data set is interupted because the function is returned -> this leads to missing files error

Redundant code : 
same code in json_to_tensor copied in schedule utils

Unused running code :
template schedule is never used , only to get the tree prog which you can get previously

Reduced disk access input/output:
using a new method to remove generating input/output c++ files 

Model : 
Skip initializing the model and reading weight everytim we initialize schedulecontroller class
Put model in evaluation mode
